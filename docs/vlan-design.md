# VLAN Design

VLANs are used to segment departments into separate broadcast domains.

- VLAN 10  → ADMIN
- VLAN 20  → HR
- VLAN 30  → FINANCE
- VLAN 40  → BUSINESS
- VLAN 50  → E & C
- VLAN 60  → A & D
- VLAN 70  → LAB
- VLAN 80  → IT-DEPT
- VLAN 90  → BRANCH-LAB
- VLAN 100 → BRANCH-STAFF

Trunk links carry VLANs between network devices using 802.1Q tagging.
