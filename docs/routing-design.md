# Routing Design

Routing protocol used: **RIP version 2**

Why RIP v2 (for this lab):
- Easy to configure
- Supports classless routing
- Suitable for small educational campus labs

Configured on:
- Main Campus Router
- Branch Router
- Cloud Router

Verification:
- `show ip route`
- End-to-end ping between VLANs and across WAN
